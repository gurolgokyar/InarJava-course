Write a program that reads words from a text file and displays all the non-duplicate words
in ascending order. The text file should be prompt to the user.
***Question_24 :
Generate an Arraylist of 10 random Integer numbers, nums, and an integer k. Write a Java
function to determine if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i]
and nums[j] are both in the array, and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
If there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] and nums[j] are both
in the array, and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k it should return true.
Otherwise, it should return false. Use a HashSet to efficiently check for duplicates as you
iterate through the array.
